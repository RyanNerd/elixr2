You learn a foreign language.

Most creatures that live in or near a civilized society have a shared language referred to as Common. Most creatures, including Characters, are assumed to know Common by default.

A GM may forbid certain languages based on the background of your character,
depending on if they would have ever had the chance to be aware of a given language.

The languages differ based on your GM's world, but some standard examples are:

+ Orcish
+ Gnomish
+ Dwarven
+ Elven
+ Draconic (language of Dragons)
+ Giant
+ Undercommon (subterranean dialect of common)
+ Auran (language of the Elemental Plane of Air)
+ Ignan (language of the Elemental Plane of Fire)
+ Terran (language of the Elemental Plane of Earth)
+ Aquan (language of the Element Plane of Water)
+ Infernal (language of the Infernal Plane)
+ Celestial (language of the Celestial Plane)
