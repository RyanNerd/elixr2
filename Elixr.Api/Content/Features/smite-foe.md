Once per day, you may declare an attack as "Smiting". You must do so before the attack roll is made.

On a successful attack, the result of the damage roll is automatically doubled.

The Feature can be taken multiple times. Each time "stacks" the day. Meaning if a Creature has the Feature thrice, they may use Smite Foe 3 times per day.
