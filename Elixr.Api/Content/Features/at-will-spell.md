Choose a spell that you already know. 

You can now cast that spell without needing to Channel Energy. The spell is cast as though the Energy Channelled is equal to your Focus Bonus. 

If you want to cast a spell with more Energy than your Focus Bonus, you cannot use this Feature.

Concentration spells can be cast this way, but as long as Concentration is maintained, Channelled Energy does not reduce at the start of your turn as normal.

Speed Cost to cast remains the same, and unless otherwise specified, still requires hand movements and vocalization as normal.
