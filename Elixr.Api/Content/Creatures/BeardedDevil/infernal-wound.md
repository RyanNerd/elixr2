 The damage a bearded devil deals with its glaive causes a persistent wound. An injured creature loses 2 points of Energy at the start of their turn and the start of every turn thereafter. The wound does not heal naturally, such as through resting. The continuing Energy loss can be stopped by a Difficulty 16 Medicine check. If the affected Creature gains Energy in any way, the effect ceases.
