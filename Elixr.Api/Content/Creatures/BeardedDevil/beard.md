If a bearded devil hits a single opponent with both claw attacks, it automatically hits with its beard. The affected creature takes 1d8+2 points of damage and has a 15% chance of contracting a vile disease known as devil chills (incubation period 1d4 days, damage 1d4 Str). Damage is dealt each day until the disease is cured magically, or the creature dies.
