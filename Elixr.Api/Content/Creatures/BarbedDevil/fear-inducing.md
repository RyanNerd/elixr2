If a creature has been hit by a barbed devil, that creature must begin their turn by making a Concentration check with a Difficulty of 20 or become panicked by fear.

Those that succeed become shaken for this round, and take Disadvantage for the remainder of their turn. Those that failed must use all of their Speed in fleeing and avoiding danger for the next 9 rounds.

Whether or not the check is successful, that creature cannot be affected by that same barbed devilâ€™s fear ability for 24 hours.
