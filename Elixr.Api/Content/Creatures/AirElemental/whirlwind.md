 The elemental can transform itself into a whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to {0} round(s).

 The whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, and up to {1}ft tall, but must be least 10ft tall.

 Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the elemental moves into or through the creature’s space.

 When a whirlwind enters a space, creatures with an Acrobatics Defense lower than {2} become picked up and held suspended in the powerful winds, taking {3} of damage. At the beginning of the Elemental's next turn, any creatures still trapped inside the whirlwind take the same amount of damage. An Acrobatics check with a Difficulty of {2} can be made to escape on an afflicted creature's turn. The Movement Speed cost for flying effects are doubled while in the whirlwind.

 The elemental can have only as many creatures trapped inside the whirlwind at one time as will fit inside the whirlwind’s volume.

 The elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane.

 If the whirlwind’s base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the whirlwind’s height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet.

 Those caught in the cloud must succeed on a Concentration check with Difficulty 15 to cast a spell.
