Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a wraith at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range. 

A panicked creature takes disadvantage on checks and attacks, and will attempt to flee, avoiding other dangers.
