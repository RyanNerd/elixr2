 The trapped essence provides a measure of magical protection. If any mind-affecting spells are cast at the devourer and overcome its Concentration Defense, they affect the imprisoned essence instead.  
 
 
 In many cases, this deflection effectively neutralizes the spell. Some of these effects might eliminate the trapped essence, depriving the devourer of its spell-like abilities until it can consume another victim.
