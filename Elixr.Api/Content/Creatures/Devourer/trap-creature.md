The devourer is named for its ability to consume an enemy’s life essence. To do so, it must forgo its normal melee attacks and make a trap essence attack. This requires a normal attack roll but deals no damage. If the result of the attack roll is greater than the target's Concentration Defense,the target's essence is trapped within the devourer’s ribs, and the tiny figure takes on that victim’s features. The trapped essence cannot be Resurrected, but reality altering magic might free it, as does destroying the devourer. A devourer can hold only one essence at a time.


All of the spells that the Devourer casts use the Energy of the trapped Creature. The devourer cannot channel more than 5 points of the trapped creature's Energy per spell cast. The Energy that the devourer channels causes the trapped Creature's Max and Current Energy to be reduced by the same amount. If the trapped creature's Max Energy falls to 0 or below, the creature is destroyed, leaving no remains.
