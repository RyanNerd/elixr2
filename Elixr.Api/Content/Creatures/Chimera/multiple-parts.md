Each Chimera head can act individually. Treat each head as its own creature that acts on the Chimera's turn. Each head has a Movement Speed of 30ft and the only action it can do is Attack (Bite for the lion and dragon heads, gore for the goat head). The Dragon head can additionally speak, but only does so if at risk of dying, and cannot attack while doing so.

Thus, it's possible for the Chimera to have 5 attacks: lion bite, dragon bite, goat gore, and each claw once.
