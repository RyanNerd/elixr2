An arrowhawk is a predator and scavenger from the Elemental Plane of Air. 

Arrowhawks are extremely territorial and always hungry. They attack almost any other creature they meet, seeking a meal or trying to drive away a rival. The primary mode of attack is an electricity ray, fired from the tail. The creature also bites, but it prefers to stay out of reach.
