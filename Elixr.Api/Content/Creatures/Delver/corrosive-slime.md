A delver produces a mucuslike slime that contains a highly corrosive substance. The slime is particularly effective against stone. A delver’s mere touch deals 2d6 points of acid damage to organic creatures or objects. Against metallic creatures or objects, a delver’s slime deals 4d8 points of damage, and against stony creatures (including earth elementals) or objects it deals 8d10 points of damage. 

A slam attack by a delver leaves a patch of slime that deals 2d6 points of damage on contact and another 2d6 points of damage in each of the next 2 rounds. A large quantity (at least a quart) of water or weak acid, such as vinegar, washes off the slime. An opponent’s armor and clothing dissolve and become useless immediately unless the wearer succeeds on a Difficutly 22 Acrobatics check at the start of their turn. Weapons that strike a delver also dissolve immediately unless the wielder makes and succeeds on a Difficulty 22 Acrobatics save. A creature attacking a delver with natural weapons takes damage from its slime each time an attack hits unless the creature makes and succeeds on a Difficulty 22 Acrobatics save.
