 A belker, while using its Gaseous Form spell, can engulf opponents by moving on top of them. It fills the air around one Medium or smaller opponent. 
 
 If the target begins their turn engulfed by the belker, they inhale part of the creature. If the target is aware of this effect, or succeed on an Insight check with a Difficulty of 13, they can attempt to hold their breath with a Concentration Check with a Difficulty of 14.
 
 If a target has inhaled smoke, the inhaled smoke solidifies into a claw and begins to rip at the surrounding organs, dealing 3d4 points of damage at the start of the belker's turn until the smoke is expunged or the belker no longer engulfs the creature. 

 Smoke can be expunged by spending 40ft of Movement Speed on coughing.
