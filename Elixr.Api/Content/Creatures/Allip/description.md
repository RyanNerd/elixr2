An allip is the spectral remains of someone driven to suicide by a madness that afflicted it in life. It craves only revenge and unrelentingly pursues those who tormented it in life and pushed it over the brink.

An allip cannot speak intelligibly. 

### Combat

An allip is unable to cause physical harm, although it doesnâ€™t appear to know that. It keeps flailing away at enemies, yet it inflicts no physical wounds.

As an incorporeal creature, an Allip is immune to physical attacks. Only magic, or other incorporeal creatures can harm it. If a magical weapon is used against an incorporeal creature, only the magic damage is applied. Damage from the weapons's Damage ability (such as Strength or Agility), as well as the normal damage the weapon would deal is disregarded.
