 A chain devilâ€™s most awesome attack is its ability to control up to four chains within 20ft feet as a standard action, making the chains dance or move as it wishes. Treat each chain as a separate Creature that acts on the Devil's turn. Each chain has a Movement Speed of 30ft (but at least one end must be within 20ft of the Devil), and have 1 Attack, which is the same as the Chain Devil's "chain" attack. The chains have no Focus or Charm Score.

 Once in control of the chain, the devil can cause it to grow up to 15ft, regardless of the original size of the chain. Once control is ended, the chain returns to its original size.

 If the chain devil attempts to control a chain that is in possession of a Creature, the chain devil must make a Concentration check greater than the Creature's Concentration Defense. Failure means the devil cannot attempt to control that particular chain for 24 hours.

A chain devil can climb chains it controls at its normal Speed without making Climb checks.
