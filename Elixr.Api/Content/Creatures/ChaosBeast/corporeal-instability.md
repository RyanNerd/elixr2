A blow from a chaos beast against a living creature can cause a terrible transformation. If the creature struck has a Concentration Defense less than 13 + the damage dealt, the struck creature becomes a spongy, amorphous mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see below), its shape melts, flows, writhes, and boils.

An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, rings, and helmets become useless. Large items worn or carried—armor, backpacks, even shirts—hamper more than help, reducing the victim’s Agility score by 4. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed to one-quarter normal. Searing pain courses along the nerves, so strong that the victim cannot act coherently. The victim cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (–4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll).

Each round the victim spends in an amorphous state causes 1 point of Focus drain from mental shock. If the victim’s Focus score falls to 0, it becomes a chaos beast.

A victim can regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a Difficulty 15 Concentration Check. A success reestablishes the creature’s normal form for 1 minute. On a failure, the victim can still repeat this check each round until successful.

Corporeal instability is not a disease or a curse and so is hard to remove. A restoration spell is required to permanently remove the affliction.
