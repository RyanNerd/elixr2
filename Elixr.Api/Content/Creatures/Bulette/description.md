Also known as the landshark, the bulette is a terrifying predator that lives only to eat.

### Combat

A bulette attacks anything it regards as edible, choosing the easiest or closest prey first. The only creatures it refuses to eat are elves (and it dislikes the taste of dwarves). When burrowing underground, a landshark relies on its Tremorsense Feature to detect prey.
