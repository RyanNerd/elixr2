The dungeon-dwelling Destrachan looks like some bizarre, non-intelligent beast, but it’s an incredibly evil and crafty sadist. A Destrachan has a pair of complex, three-part ears that it can adjust to be more or less sensitive to various sounds. It is blind, yet hunts with a sense of hearing more precise than most creatures’ sight.

From its tubular mouth a destrachan emits carefully focused harmonics, producing sonic energy so powerful it can shatter a stone wall. So skilled is a destrachan at controlling the sounds it emits that it can choose what type of material to affect with its attack.

A destrachan speaks no language but understands Common. If a destrachan must communicate, it does so through action.

### Combat

A Destrachan uses its claws only as a last resort or to finish off foes weakened by its sonic attacks. It often enters battle with surprise if possible. It first focuses on destroying metal armor and weapons and then changes to harmonics that disrupt flesh.

It's Destructive Harmonic attacks can also be performed as a 30ft radius instead of the default conic.
