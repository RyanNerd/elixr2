 As an action with no Speed Cost, Bone Devils can create an aura of fear in a 5-foot radius. Opponents within this radius must start their turn by making a Concentration check with a Difficulty of 17. If their check does not exceed 17 become paralyzed with fear until no longer within the radius, or they succeed on a Concentration Check on their next turn.

 Once successful, a creature is unaffected by the aura for another 24 hours.

 Other devils are immune to this aura.

 A creature paralyzed with fear continues to defend itself by instinct and is not considered helpless.
