A chuul can transfer grabbed victims from a claw to its tentacles as an action with a Speed Cost of 30ft. 

The tentacles grapple with the same strength as the claw but deal no damage. However, they exude a paralytic secretion. On the chuul's turn, 3d6 are rolled. If the result of this is roll is higher than the creature's Level + 15, that creature is paralyzed for 6 rounds. For creatures without levels (non player creatures or NPCs), this affect is applied when the roll is higher than the creature's Power / 20. 

While held in the tentacles, paralyzed or not, a victim automatically takes 1d8+2 points of damage each round from the creatureâ€™s mandibles.
