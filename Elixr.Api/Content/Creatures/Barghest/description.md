A barghest is a lupine fiend that can take the shape of a wolf or a goblin. In its natural form, it resembles a goblinâ€“wolf hybrid with terrible jaws and sharp claws. As whelps, barghests are nearly indistinguishable from wolves, except for their size and claws. As they grow larger and stronger, their skin darkens to bluishred and eventually becomes blue altogether.
