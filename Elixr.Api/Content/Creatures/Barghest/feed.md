When a barghest slays a humanoid opponent, it can feed on the corpse, devouring both flesh and life force, as a an action with a Speed Cost of 60ft.

 Feeding destroys the victimâ€™s body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse.

A barghest gains Power by consuming corpses in this fashion. For every three suitable corpses a barghest devours, it gains 2 to its Max Energy, and its Strength, and natural armor increase by +1. 
It gains additional Max Energy, Ability Points and Skill Points, and other changes as though it was a character that had leveled.

The barghest only advances by consuming the corpses of creatures whose Power are equal to or greater than its own current total. A barghest that consumes 9 corpses through feeding immediately becomes a greater barghest upon completion of the act.
