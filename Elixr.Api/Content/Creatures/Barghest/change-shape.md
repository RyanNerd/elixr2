A barghest can assume the shape of a goblin or a wolf as an action with a Speed Cost of 30ft.

In goblin form, a barghest cannot use its natural weapons but can wield weapons and wear armor. In wolf form, a barghest loses its claw attacks but retains its bite attack.

While in wolf form, the barghest can move through any type of terrain and leave neither footprints nor scent. Tracking the subjects is impossible by nonmagical means.
