 A bebilith can throw a web up to four times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 30 feet. This attack is effective against targets of up to Gargantuan size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.

 An entangled creature can escape with a Difficulty 24 Escape Artist check or burst the web with a Difficulty 24 Strength check. The web has 14 hit points. There is a 75% chance that the webbing will not burn if any sort of fire is applied to it (check each round).
