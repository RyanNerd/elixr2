The behir is a serpentine monster that can slither like a snake or use its dozen legs to move with considerable speed. It can fold its limbs close to its long, narrow body and slither in snake fashion if it desires. The two large horns curving back over the head look dangerous but are actually used for preening the creatureâ€™s scales, not for fighting.

Behirs speak Common.

### Combat

A behir usually bites and grabs its prey first, then either swallows or constricts the opponent with its Crush attack. It can employ its claws only against foes caught in its coils. If beset by a large number of foes, it uses its Energy Blast, Electric -- which is expelled from the mouth of the creature.
