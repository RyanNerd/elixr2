A behir can try to swallow a grabbed Medium or smaller opponent by making a successful grapple check.

A swallowed creature takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning damage and 8 points of acid damage from the behir’s gizzard at the start of the behir's turn. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the gizzard (Defense 15). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. 

A behir’s gizzard can hold 400lbs of mass.
