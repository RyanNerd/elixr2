 Once per day an avoral can create an aura of fear in a 20-foot radius. Opponents within this radius must start their turn by making a Concentration check with a Difficulty of 17. If their check does not exceed 17 become paralyzed with fear while still in their radius, or until they succeed on a Concentration Check on their next turn.

 A creature paralyzed with fear continues to defend itself by instinct and is not considered helpless.
