A cloaker can manipulate shadows. This ability is effective only in shadowy areas and has three possible effects.

Obscure Vision: The cloaker gains concealment (20% miss chance) for 1d4 rounds.

Dancing Images: This effect acts as though an Illusion spell was used 1d4 times to create illusory duplicates of the cloaker. The duplicates vanish when struck, but otherwise act exactly as the the real cloaker (pretending to mimic its actions). Each duplicate has a Defense of 12.

Silent Image: This effect duplicates an Illusion spell cast with 6 Energy Channeled.
