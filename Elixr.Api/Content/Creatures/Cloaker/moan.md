A cloaker can emit a dangerous subsonic moan as a standard action. By changing the frequency, the cloaker can cause one of four effects. Cloakers are immune to these sonic, mindaffecting attacks. Unless otherwise specified, if an effect fails to overcome a target's Concentration Defense, or the target's skill check succeeds, the target is immune to the effect for 24 hours.

Unnerve: Anyone within a 60-foot spread automatically takes a â€“2 penalty on attack and damage rolls. Those forced to hear the moan for more than 6 consecutive rounds must make a Difficulty 15 Concentration check save or enter a trance, unable to attack or defend themselves until the moaning stops.

Fear: Anyone within a 30-foot spread that begins their turn after the moan was sounded must make a Concentration Check with a Difficulty 15 or take Disadvantage for 2 rounds.

Nausea: Anyone within a 30-foot cone that begins their turn after the moan was sounded must make a Concentration Check with a Difficulty 15 or fall prone and become naseated for 1d41 + 1.

Stupor: A single creature within a 30-foot that begins their turn after the moan was sounded must make a Concentration Check with a Difficulty 15 or remain motionless as if compelled to do so. They may retry their check at the start of each of their turns. Even after a successful check, the creature can use this effect again.
