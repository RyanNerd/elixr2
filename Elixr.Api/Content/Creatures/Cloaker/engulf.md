A cloaker can try to wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its body as a grapple by making an Athletics check against the target's Acrobatics or Atheltics Defense, whichever is higher.

If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and bites the engulfed victim with a +4 bonus on its attack roll. It can still use its whiplike tail to strike at other targets.
