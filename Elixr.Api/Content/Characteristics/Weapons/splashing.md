Can only be applied to weapons that target an Area of Effect (such as conic weapons, or those that specify a radius), and target specifically an Acrobatics Defense.

Any creature that intersects or is contained within the Area of Effect take half damage, even when the result of the roll is less than or equal to that creature's Acrobatics Defense. Attacks that are greater than that creature's Acrobatics Defense take damage as normal.
