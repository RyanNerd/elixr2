Attacks made with this weapon deal non-lethal damage. When a blow from this weapon knocks a Creature to below 0 Energy, they do not lose 1 point of Energy at the start of their turn due to "bleeding out". Additionally, if the blow dealt with this weapon brought the victim to below negative ten (-10), the victim does not immediately die. Any additional damage to a creature below -10 will cause them to die, even if that damage is non-lethal.
