A target's Effective Defense against attacks made with a weapon having this characteristic does not include any Armor worn.

Generally, this means their Effective Defense is simply their Agility Bonus + {0}.

It generally means that the attack must simply connect with the target rather than penetrate for the attack to be effective. This means spells such as Mage Armor provide no benefit against this.
