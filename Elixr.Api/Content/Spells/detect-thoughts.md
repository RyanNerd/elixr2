You're able to read the mind of a subject you can see that has a Focus Score greater than 2. 

Roll 1d6 per Energy Channeled. If the result of this roll, known as the Penetration Result, is greater than the target's Concentration Defense you are able to know what they are currently thinking about.

If a subject becomes aware that their mind is being read (through an Insight check or some other means), they can intentionally think about non-sensical or unimportant things. A subject that is aware may make a Concentration Check at the start of their turn with a Difficulty equal to the Penetration Result. Success causes the spell to end.
