For every point of Energy Channeled it becomes 5% harder to hit you or a creature you touch. 

For example, if you channel 6 points of Energy, it is 30% harder to hit you. Any foe that makes a successful attack against you must also roll a percentile. If the result of the percentile is less than 30%, the attack is unsuccessful.

This spell only allows you to get up to 90% concealment.
