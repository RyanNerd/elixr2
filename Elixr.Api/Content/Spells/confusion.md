Roll on the following table at the beginning of each subject’s turn each round to see what the subject does in that round.

d%|Behavior
---|---
01-10|Attack caster with melee or ranged weapons (or close with caster if attack is not possible).
11-20|Act normally
21-50|Do nothing but babble incoherently.
51-70|Flee away from caster at top possible speed.
71-100|Attack nearest creature (for this purpose, an animal companion counts as part of the subject’s self).

A confused character who can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused when its turn comes.
