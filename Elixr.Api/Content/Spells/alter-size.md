The subject of the spell either doubles its height and multiplies it weight by 8 for every 4 points of Energy Channeled (Enlarging)

Or The subject of the spell havles its height and divides its weight by 8 for every 4 points of Energy channeled. (Reducing)

This changes the creatures size category to the next higher or smaller.

For example, if 8 points of Energy was channeled to enlarge a medium creature, that creature would now be considered Huge, and would take the mods that the Huge characteristic describes.

If 12 points of Energy were channeled on a Huge creature to reduce them, their size category would now be Small (12 / 4 = 3 changes. Huge -> *Large* -> *Medium* -> *Small*)

If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it— the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.

All equipment worn or carried by a creature also changes size proportionally. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any enlarged item that leaves an enlarged creature’s possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. Magical properties of size altered items are not increased by this spell.

Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.
