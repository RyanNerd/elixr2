This enchantment clouds the mind of a creature so that it takes no actions.

Roll 1d6 per point of Energy Channelled. If the result of this roll, called the Penetration Result, is greater than the target's Concentration Defense, the spell is successful.

On an affected Creature's turn, it can make a Concentration check with a Difficutly equal to the Penetration Result. If this check is greater than the Penetration Result, they are no longer dazed, even if concentration is still maintained by the caster.

A dazed creature still defends itself on instinct, so attackers get no special advantage against it.
