You bring a creature that has died back to life.

The creature’s Max Energy becomes the Energy that you Channel to cast this spell, or what the creature’s Max Energy was while they were alive, whichever is lower.

You must concentrate on this spell for an equal length of time as the creature being resurrected was dead. During this time, you enter a deathlike, catatonic state in which you go limp and become unaware of your surroundings. After this time has elapsed, the spell ends andt the target is brought back to life and you resume consciousness.
