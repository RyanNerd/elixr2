You're able to discern information that is yet to occur.

Because the feature is fluid, information you see is foggy, unclear and vague.

To divinate the outcome of a specific event depends on how complex the event's circumstances are. The GM sets a Difficulty using the following as a guideline:

Complexity|Difficulty
---|---
Simple|20
Complex|30
Enigmatic|60

For every point of Energy that was Channeled when this spell was cast, roll 1d4.

Accurate divination takes time. For each minute that is spent concentrating, the Deffective Difficulty is lowered by 1.

Once the result of your roll exceeds to the Difficulty, you are able to discern information.

If, while concentrating on the spell, you are touching a reflective surface, such as a pool or mirror, the images you receive can be cast on them.

Just because you divinate an event does not mean it is certain to occur, just that it seems likely at the time that the divination was performed.
