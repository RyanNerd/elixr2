You assume the form of a specific creature that you have seen, using their stats in place of your own, with the exception of maintinaing your own Current Energy.

The Channeled Energy required to cast this spell must equal the Power of the Creature divided by 10.

Any gear melds into your new form.

If your new form cannot vocalize, you cannot cast spells requiring vocalization. If your new form does not have fingers, you cannot cast spells requiring hand movement.

When the spell ends, you revert to normal form.

This Spell can be learned multiple times, but each time is for a different Creature.
