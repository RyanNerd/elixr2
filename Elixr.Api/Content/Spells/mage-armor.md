For every 3 points of Energy Channeled, you or a creature you touch gains a +1 Defense Bonus.

This bonus comes from a magical force field that surrounds the subject. This force field does not incur any penalties. Since Mage Armor is made of force, incorporeal creatures can't bypass it the way they do normal armor.
