You, or a creature you touch, gain 5% of concealment for every point of Energy channeled, as you rapidly alter between being visible and invisible. The rules for the spell Invisibility apply for the percent of time you spend invisible, meaning that you cannot move through physical objects.

This spell only allows you to gain up to 90% concealment, regardless of how much energy is channeled.

See the rules for concealment in the Playing the Game section.
