By taking an object of similar size, shape, and weight as a desired object, you are able to temporarily turn it into the desired object.

For every point of Energy Channeled, 10 pounds of mass can be transmuted. All mass must be physically connected.

The original object and the desired object cannot be magical or living.

For desired objects made out of more rare elements, The Energy Cost is increased using the following as guideline:

Rarity|Multiplier
---|---
Common|x1
Uncommon|x2
Rare|x3

If you lose Concentration, the object reverts to it's original state.

By choosing to sacrifice the Energy they used to cast this spell, a creature can make a conjured object permanent. This must be declared before the spell ends.
