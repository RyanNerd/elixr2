The subject(s) and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes worthless, though its size, Agility, deflection bonuses, and armor bonuses from force effects still apply. The subject gains Resistance against physical attacks (Slashing, Bludgeoning, and Piercing), and becomes immune to poison and critical hits.

It can’t cast spells that require movements or spoken words. The subject also loses supernatural Features while in gaseous form.

A gaseous creature is considered to have a Movement Speed of 20ft with the Natural Flyer Characteristic. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can’t enter water or other liquid. It also can’t manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot.

All subjects must be connected through touch at the time the spell was cast, but can move independently afterwards.

If attempting to use on an unwilling Creature, you can attempt to penetrate their Concentration Defense by rolling 1d6/Energy Channeled. If the result of this roll, referred to as the Penetration Result, is greater than the target's Concentration Defense, the target becomes gaseous.
On the target's turn, they may attempt a concentration check with a Difficulty equal to the Penetration Result. On success they are no longer gaseous.
