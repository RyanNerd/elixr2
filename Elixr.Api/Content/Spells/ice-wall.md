A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. For every point of Energy Channeled, 25ft of ice volume is created that can be distributed in any direction. For example, if 1 point of Energy is channeled, a wall could be made that is 10ft high, 5ft wide, and 10ft thick (10 + 5 + 10 = 25). If 8 points of Energy is channeled, the wall can have a volume of 25f * 5, or 125f. Meaning, any combinations of dimensions that add up to 125 can be used. For example, 100ft wide, 5ft thick and 20ft high.

The wall must be at least 5ft wide (or 1ft thick).

 The wall can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.
