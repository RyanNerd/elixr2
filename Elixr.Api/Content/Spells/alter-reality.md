Alter Reality is the most versatile spell. The only limit is that the spell cannot permanently alter free-will, at least not entirely (the subject will always feel like something is wrong if this attempted on them). Otherwise, you permanently make a change to the world. 

The Energy Requirement for the spell depends on the magnitude of the requested effect. The GM determines this using similar spells (to the desired effect) as a reference, as well as their own discretion.

It is not recommended for lower-level characters to learn this spell, as the Energy Requirement will almost always be higher than their Max Energy.

 **Sample Flavors**
+ You learned this power from a genie.
+ Your deity has granted you his power temporarily.
+ You've discovered a forgotten, dangerous, form of arcana.
