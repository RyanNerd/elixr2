A sheet of shimmering violet fire appears. For every point of Energy Channeled, 25ft of fire volume is created that can be distributed in any direction. For example, if 1 point of Energy is channeled, a wall could be made that is 10ft high, 5ft wide, and 10ft thick (10 + 5 + 10 = 25). If 8 points of Energy is channeled, the wall can have a volume of 25f * 5, or 125f. Meaning, any combinations of dimensions that add up to 125 can be used. For example, 100ft wide, 5ft thick and 20ft high.

The wall must be at least 5ft wide (or 1ft thick).

Creatures within 10ft of the wall take 2d4 points of Fire Damage. Those within 20ft take 1d4 of fire damage. Creatures passing through the fire take 2d6 of damage.

If the wall is evoked so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.

5ft sections of wall can be extinguised if the section takes 20 points of cold damage.
