You move an object or creature with your mind.

For every point of Energy Channeled, you can move 10 pounds of mass.

Moving an object 5ft has a Movement Speed Cost of 5ft of your own Speed. 

To move creatures against their will, you must Channel enough Energy for their weight as noted above, additionally you must roll 1d4/Energy Channeled. If the result of this roll (the penetration result) exceeds the target's Concentration Defense, they can be moved. On the creature's turn, if the spell is still in effect, that creature can make a Concentration check. If the result of this check exceeds the penetration result, they are no longer affected by this spell. To use telekinesis on them again would require casting a new spell.

A creature dropped from telekinesis takes damage as though they had fallen.

Hurling an object at a creature requires a Spell Attack (1d20 + Focus Bonus). If the result of the attack exceeds the target's Defense, they take 1d4 for every 10 pounds the object weighs.
