You can see magically concealed creatures or objects, such as those with the Invisibility spell cast upon them.

For every point of Energy channeled, roll 1d6. 
If the result of this roll exceeds the Concentration Defense of the caster that caused the concealing effect at the time the concealing effect was cast, you can see through the concealment as though it had never been cast.
