You tell a creature that can hear and understand you a command which they must obey.

To succesfully Compel a creature, roll 1d6 per Energy channeled. If the result of the attack is greater than the target's Concentration Defense, they are compelled.

For every step above neutral (in the positive direction) a creature is on the Attitude track towards you, their effective Concentration Defense is lowered by 2.

For every step below neutral (in the negative direction) a creature is on the Attitude track towards you, their effective Concentration Defense is increased by 2.

If the command involves having the target injure themselves or those they care about, their effective Concentration Defense is increased by 5 for the sake of this spell.

If you lose your Channeled Energy for any reason, such as from taking damage, the spell ends immediately, even if the target has not completed their command.

If the target loses Energy, the spell ends immediately.

A creature can only have one command compelled on them at a time. To chain commands, Compel must be cast again.
