You detect the surface thoughts of a creature you can see.

For every point of Energy channeled, roll 1d6. If the result exceeds the creature's Concentration Defense, you know what they are thinking in that moment.

If the target has a Focus Bonus of at least 1, they are aware of your presence in their mind and may alter their thoughts accordingly.
