By touching one or more Creatures, you can transfer Current Energy between them or yourself. The sum of all involved Creatures Current Energy remains the same, only the distribution changes.

The Energy you Channel for this spell is how much you are allowed redistribute between the participants.

To transfer Energy from an unwilling Creature, you must roll 1d6 per Energy Channeled. If the result of this roll is greater than the target's Concentration Defense, you are able to redistribute their Energy.

No Creature's Current Energy can exceed their Max Energy, if this occurs, the extra Energy must be redistributed until no Creature has more Current Energy than Max Energy.
