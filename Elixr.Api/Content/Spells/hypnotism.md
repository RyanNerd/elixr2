Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures that can hear you, causing them to stop and stare blankly at you. In addition, you can use their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more plausible.

Roll 1d4 for every point of Energy Channeled. If the result of this roll exceeds the target's Concentration Defense, they become hynotized. The result of this is called the Penetration Result.

If the Penetration Result does not exceed the target's Concentration Defense, the target is unaware that they were the subject of a hypnotism spell. They may, however, make an insight check on their turn, if given a reason to suspect foul play.

A hypnotized creature takes no actions other than to pay attention the the caster. They take Disadvantage on perception checks that relate to anybody or thing that is not the caster.

Hypnotized creatures react as though they are two steps more friendly on the attitude track. This allows you to make a single request of the affected creature (provided you can communicate with it). The request must be brief and reasonable. Even after the spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only with respect to that particular request.

An ally can shake a hynotize creature out of their hypnotism. Additionally, if the hypnotized creature feels threatened, such as seeing a sword drawn from its sheath, the creature may make a Concentration check. If the result of this roll exceeds the original Penetration Result, the creature is no longer fascinated. If the creature loses Energy for any reason, the hypnotism is immediately broken.
