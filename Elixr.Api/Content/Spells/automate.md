You specify a trigger and a certain action automatically occurs for as long as you concentrate on it.

The amount of Energy required depends on how arduous the task you're automating would be to perform manually. The GM determines this using this table as guideline:

Difficulty|Required Energy|Example
---|---|---
Simple|1|Writing a letter
Easy|2|Open/close a door
Basic|3|Sewing
Tough|4|Draw a picture
Hard|5|Play an instrument


You cannot automate an object to perform an action that it would be incapable of doing manually.

This spell has no effect on living creatures.
