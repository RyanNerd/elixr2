You temporarily change what plane of existence you're on.

For every point of Energy Channeled, you can shift 100 pounds of mass. All objects/creatures must be connected through touch.

What planes exist in the world is determined by your GM, but typically include the Material Plane, Ethereal Plane, Water Plane, Earth Plane, Fire Plane, Air Plane, Celestial Plane, and Infernal Plane. These are described in the Running the Game section. 

At the end of the spell you return to the same location on the plane you left from.

To permanently stay on the same plane, you can choose to sacrifice the Energy that was Channeled for this spell (reducing your Current Energy by that amount).
