You transport 200 pounds of mass/Energy Channeled to a remote location. All objects/creatures must be touching at the time the spell was cast.

While teleporting, you are actual flying through the ethreal plane. For every 5ft of travelling you do on the ethreal plane, you move 100ft towards your destination on the Material Plane.
This means if you spend 60ft of Movement Speed on travelling while teleporting, you can arrive at a destination 6000ft away from where you started.

Travelling through the ethreal has a Movement Speed Cost as normal (5ft/5ft moved). If your destination is farther than your Speed can bring you, it will take multiple turns to reach your destination.

The longer you spend in the ethreal plane, the more likely threats from that plane may appear, at your GM's discretion. Movement Speed used in dealing with these threats can not be applied towards travelling (thus extending how long it may take to arrive at your destination).

If the caster of Teleport loses their Channeled Energy, such as from taking damage, all creatures that had the Teleport spell cast on them fall back to the Material Plane at a location corresponding to how much Movement Speed was spent for travelling to the destination in the Material Plane. In other words, if a creature had moved 30ft in the ethreal plane, they would be 300ft away from where they started in the Material Plane.

All creatures that were transported using this spell take on the Speed of the caster at the time the spell was cast while travelling through the ethreal plane. This means that if a caster with a Speed of 60ft casts this spell on a creature with a Speed of 50ft, that creature's Effective Speed becomes 60ft while they are in the Ethreal plane. Conversely, if a caster with a Speed of 50ft casts Teleport on a Creature with 60ft, that creature's Effective Speed becomes 50ft while travelling through the Ethreal plane.

If you cannot see or have never been to the destination, there's a chance of ending up in a wall or object.
This depends on how much "clutter" is at the destination, as determined by the GM. For example, the GM may say something like "There's a 30% chance you'll end up in something." In this case, you must roll a percentile. If the result is 30% or less, you are immediately shunted to the nearest open square, and you lose your channeled Energy as though you had been hit by an attack.
