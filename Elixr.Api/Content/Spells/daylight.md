You or an object you touch sheds light as bright as full daylight. The radius of this light is 5ft for every point of Energy Channeled.

Creatures with an Aversion to sunlight take appropritate penalties for 1d4 rounds if in the radius of the spell when it is cast.

If a Daylight spell intersects a Darkness spell, the intersection negates and is lit as though no lighting spells were in effect in that area.
